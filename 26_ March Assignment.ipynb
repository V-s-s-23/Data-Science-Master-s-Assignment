    "# Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "## Answer:-\n",
    "### 1. Simple Linear Regression:- Simple linear regression involves analyzing the relationship between Single independent variables and a dependent variable.\n",
    "### 2. Multiple Linear Regression:- multiple linear regression involves analyzing the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.\n",
    "### For example, a multiple linear regression can be used to model the relationship between a car's fuel efficiency and its weight, horsepower, and engine displacement. In this case, weight, horsepower, and engine displacement would be the independent variables, and fuel efficiency would be the dependent variable."

    "### 1. Normality- Data follows a Normal Distribution.\n",
    "### 2. Linearity:- The relationship between Independent Variable and Dependent Variable must be Linear.\n",

    "# Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using a real-world scenario.\n",
    "### Answer:- In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are coefficients that represent the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable(s) are equal to zero.\n",
    "### For example, consider a simple linear regression model that aims to predict a person's salary (dependent variable) based on their years of experience (independent variable). The equation for this model is:"

    "### Answer:- Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is used to minimize a cost function by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model.\n",
    "### To use gradient descent in machine learning, the first step is to define a cost function that measures how well the model fits the training data. The next step is to initialize the model parameters with some initial values, and then iteratively update the parameters using the gradient descent algorithm. The learning rate, which determines the size of the parameter update, is an important hyperparameter that needs to be tuned carefully to ensure the algorithm converges to the optimal values of the parameters."

Unlike linear regression, polynomial regression allows for a more complex, curved relationship between the variables."

Disadvantages are overfitting, sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity. Use polynomial regression when data has non-linear patterns and linear regression is not sufficient."
